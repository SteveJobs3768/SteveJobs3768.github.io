Hi There!
My name is Steve Jobs, and I am world-famous as the co-founder and CEO of Apple. But this website isn't about Apple. 
This is my personal blogging website. I basically talk about myself here. By the way, just to let you know, this website
was created with Jekyll, Github, GoDaddy, and Codecademy.
